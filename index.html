                <p class="p-lrg">Welcome to the website of the post-pfunk / Salop-Hop band Adult Play from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, UK. Not to be confused with <span class="strike">Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.</span></p>
                <p class="p-lrg">We're not sure what you were expecting to find here, but we hope you aren't too disappointed.</p>
                <hr>

                <p class="grey-txt">We wrote that song that Simon Le Bon likes that has that 'flats in dagenham' cadence. 'Duh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh pay no more 'cus we don't owe anybody.' It's called 'See Me Now' and was played on Radio 6 Music by Tom Robinson and it was also played on Radio 1, which is nice, isn't it?</p>
                <p class="grey-txt">We thought we'd make a website to try and make us easier to find haha. We have a budget of ¬£6 for SEO and we're going to do our best to make the most of it.</p>
                <p class="grey-txt">Not that you asked, but we're recording an EP in June and it's gonna have like 3, 4 or maybe 5 tracks on there, probably. We don't know what it will be called all we know is that it will be an EP.</p>
                <p class="grey-txt">Lots of love, AP x</p>
